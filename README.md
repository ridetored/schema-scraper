# schema-scraper
This Python project is a schema scraper that retrieves structured data (schema.org) from a webpage using requests and BeautifulSoup. It fetches the page content, parses it, and extracts schema data in JSON-LD and Microdata formats, helping to analyze the structured data of any webpage.

# Key Features:
JSON-LD Schema: Extracted by looking for <script type="application/ld+json">.
Microdata Schema: Identified by HTML attributes like itemscope, itemprop.

# How It Works:
The script fetches the HTML content from the provided URL.
It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page.
It looks for schema data in two formats: JSON-LD and Microdata.
Extracted schema information is returned in a structured format for easy reading or further processing.

# How to Use:
Run the script and pass any webpage URL containing structured data (schema) as input.
The script will print the JSON-LD and Microdata schema extracted from the page.
This approach can be expanded by adding more error handling, output formatting, or even saving the schema data to a file for analysis later.
